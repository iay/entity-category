    <section title="Introduction and Motivation">
      <t>
        This document describes a SAML attribute, referred to here as the
        "entity category attribute", values of which represent entity types
        or categories. When used with the
        <xref target="SAML2MetadataAttr">SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for Entity Attributes</xref>
        each such entity category attribute value represents a claim that the entity thus labelled
        meets the requirements of, and is asserted to be a member of, the indicated category.
      </t>

      <t>
        These category membership claims MAY be used by a relying party to provision policy
        for release of attributes from an identity provider, to influence user interface decisions
        such as those related to identity provider discovery, or for any other purpose.
        In general, the intended uses of any claim of membership in a given category will
        depend on the details of the category's definition, and will often be included as
        part of that definition.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Entity category attribute values are URIs, and this document does not specify a
        controlled vocabulary.  Category URIs may therefore be defined by any appropriate
        authority without any requirement for central registration.  It is anticipated that
        other specifications may provide management and discovery mechanisms for entity category
        attribute values.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Syntax">
      <t>
        Entity category attribute values MUST be URIs.  It is RECOMMENDED that http:-scheme
        or https:-scheme URLs are used, and further RECOMMENDED that each such value
        resolves to a human-readable document defining the category.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The entity category attribute MUST be encoded as a SAML 2.0 Attribute element
        with @NameFormat urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
        http://macedir.org/entity-category.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        A SAML entity is associated with one or more categories by including the
        Attribute element described here in the entity's metadata through use of the
        <xref target="SAML2MetadataAttr"/> metadata extension, in which the
        Attribute element is contained within an mdattr:EntityAttributes
        element directly contained within an md:Extensions element directly
        contained within the entity's md:EntityDescriptor.
        
        The meaning of the entity category attribute is undefined by this specification if it
        appears anywhere else within a metadata instance, or within any other XML document.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Semantics">
      <t>
        The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's entity attributes
        represents a series of claims (one for each attribute value) that the entity is
        a member of each named category.  The precise semantics of such a claim depend
        on the definition of the category itself.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The definition of the concept of a category is intentionally not addressed in this
        document, in order to leave it as general as possible.  However, to be useful,
        category definitions SHOULD include the following as appropriate:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A definition of the authorities who may validly assert
            membership in the category.  While membership in some categories may be
            self-asserted informally by an entity's owner, others may need to be
            validated by third parties such as the entity's home federation or other
            registrar.
          </t>
          <t>
            A set of criteria by which an entity's membership in the category can be
            objectively assessed.
          </t>
          <t>
            A definition of the processes by which valid authorities
            may determine that an entity meets the category's membership criteria.
          </t>
          <t>
            A description of the anticipated uses for category membership by relying parties.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
        If significant changes are made to a category definition, the new version of
        the category SHOULD be represented by a different category URI.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Entity category attribute value URIs MUST be treated as opaque strings.
      </t>

      <t>
        The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's entity attributes
        represents a series of claims (one for each attribute value) that the entity is
        a member of the named categories.  Before accepting and acting on such claims, any
        relying party needs to establish, at a level of assurance sufficient for the
        intended use, a chain of trust concluding that the claim is justified.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Some of the elements in such a chain of trust might include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The integrity of the metadata delivered to the relying party, as for example
            assured by a digital signature.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the entity category attribute is carried within a signed assertion, the assertion
            itself must be evaluated.
          </t>
          <t>
            The procedures and policies of the immediate source of the metadata;
            in particular, any procedures the immediate source has with regard to aggregation
            of metadata from other sources.
          </t>
          <t>
            The policies and procedures implemented by agents along the publication path from
            the original metadata registrar: this may be determined either by examination of
            the published procedures of each agent in turn, or may be simplified if the
            entity metadata includes publication path metadata as described in the
            <xref target="SAML2MetadataDRI"/> extension.
          </t>
          <t>
            The policies and procedures implemented by the original metadata registrar.
          </t>
          <t>
            The definition of the category itself; in particular, any statements it makes about
            whether membership of the category may be self-asserted, or may only be asserted
            by particular authorities.
          </t>
