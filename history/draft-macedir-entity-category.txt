1.  Introduction and Motivation

   This document describes a SAML attribute, referred to here as the
   "entity category attribute", values of which represent entity types
   or categories.  When used with the SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for
   Entity Attributes [SAML2MetadataAttr] each such entity category
   attribute value represents a claim that the entity thus labelled
   meets the requirements of, and is asserted to be a member of, the
   indicated category.

   These category membership claims MAY be used by a relying party to
   provision policy for release of attributes from an identity provider,
   to influence user interface decisions such as those related to
   identity provider discovery, or for any other purpose.  In general,
   the intended uses of any claim of membership in a given category will
   depend on the details of the category's definition, and will often be
   included as part of that definition.

   Entity category attribute values are URIs, and this document does not
   specify a controlled vocabulary.  Category URIs may therefore be
   defined by any appropriate authority without any requirement for
   central registration.  It is anticipated that other specifications
   may provide management and discovery mechanisms for entity category
   attribute values.

   A second SAML attribute, referred to here as the "entity category
   support attribute", contains URI values which represent claims by an
   entity to support and/or interoperate with entities in a given
   category or categories.  These values, defined in conjunction with
   specific entity category values, provide entities in a category with
   the means to identify peer entities that wish to interact with them
   in category-specific fashion.

2.  Entity Category Attribute

2.1.  Syntax

   Entity category attribute values MUST be URIs.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that http:-scheme or https:-scheme URLs are used, and further
   RECOMMENDED that each such value resolves to a human-readable
   document defining the category.

   The entity category attribute MUST be encoded as a SAML 2.0 Attribute
   element with @NameFormat
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
   http://macedir.org/entity-category.

   A SAML entity is associated with one or more categories by including
   the Attribute element described here in the entity's metadata through
   use of the [SAML2MetadataAttr] metadata extension, in which the
   Attribute element is contained within an mdattr:EntityAttributes
   element directly contained within an md:Extensions element directly
   contained within the entity's md:EntityDescriptor.  The meaning of
   the entity category attribute is undefined by this specification if
   it appears anywhere else within a metadata instance, or within any
   other XML document.

2.2.  Semantics

   The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's
   entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for each
   attribute value) that the entity is a member of each named category.
   The precise semantics of such a claim depend on the definition of the
   category itself.

   The definition of the concept of a category is intentionally not
   addressed in this document, in order to leave it as general as
   possible.  However, to be useful, category definitions SHOULD include
   the following as appropriate:

   o  A definition of the authorities who may validly assert membership
      in the category.  While membership in some categories may be self-
      asserted informally by an entity's owner, others may need to be
      validated by third parties such as the entity's home federation or
      other registrar.

   o  A set of criteria by which an entity's membership in the category
      can be objectively assessed.

   o  A definition of the processes by which valid authorities may
      determine that an entity meets the category's membership criteria.

Internet-Draft               Entity Category                 August 2012


   o  A description of the anticipated uses for category membership by
      relying parties.

   If significant changes are made to a category definition, the new
   version of the category SHOULD be represented by a different category
   URI.

   Entity category attribute value URIs MUST be treated as opaque
   strings.

<md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata"
      entityID="https://service.example.com/entity">
  <md:Extensions>
    <mdattr:EntityAttributes
        xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
      <Attribute xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"
          NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
          Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category">

3.  Entity Category Support Attribute

3.1.  Syntax

   Entity category support attribute values MUST be URIs.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that http:-scheme or https:-scheme URLs are used, and
   further RECOMMENDED that each such value resolves to a human-readable
   document defining the value's semantics.  A given entity category
   value MAY be associated with multiple support values in order to
   allow for multiple forms of support, participation, or interoperation
   with entities in the category.

   The entity category support attribute MUST be encoded as a SAML 2.0
   Attribute element with @NameFormat
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
   http://macedir.org/entity-category-support.

   A SAML entity claims a form of support for entities in one or more
   categories by including the Attribute element described here in the
   entity's metadata through use of the [SAML2MetadataAttr] metadata
   extension, in which the Attribute element is contained within an
   mdattr:EntityAttributes element directly contained within an md:
   Extensions element directly contained within the entity's md:
   EntityDescriptor.  The meaning of the entity category support
   attribute is undefined by this specification if it appears anywhere
   else within a metadata instance, or within any other XML document.

3.2.  Semantics

   The presence of the entity category support attribute within an
   entity's entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for
   each attribute value) that the entity supports peer entities in a
   category in a particular fashion.  The precise semantics of such a
   claim depend on the definition of the category support identifier
   itself.  Category support claims will often be defined to be self-
   asserted.

   The definition of the concept of "support" for a category is
   intentionally not addressed in this document, in order to leave it as
   general as possible.  It is assumed that entity category definitions
   MAY define one or more support values signifying particular
   definitions for "support" by peers as motivated by use cases arising
   from the definition of the category itself.

   A common case is expected to be the definition of a single support
   value whose URI is identical to that defined for the category itself.

   If significant changes are made to a category support definition, the

   new version SHOULD be represented by a different category support
   URI.

   Entity category support attribute value URIs MUST be treated as
   opaque strings.

      entityID="https://idp.example.edu/entity">
  <md:Extensions>
    <mdattr:EntityAttributes
        xmlns:mdattr="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:metadata:attribute">
      <Attribute xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"
          NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
          Name="http://macedir.org/entity-category-support">
        <AttributeValue>http://example.org/category/dog/basic</AttributeValue>
        <AttributeValue>http://example.org/category/dog/advanced</AttributeValue>
        <AttributeValue>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21829</AttributeValue>

6.  Security Considerations

   The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's
   entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for each
   attribute value) that the entity is a member of the named categories.
   Before accepting and acting on such claims, any relying party needs
   to establish, at a level of assurance sufficient for the intended
   use, a chain of trust concluding that the claim is justified.

   Some of the elements in such a chain of trust might include:

   o  The integrity of the metadata delivered to the relying party, as
      for example assured by a digital signature.

   o  If the entity category attribute is carried within a signed
      assertion, the assertion itself must be evaluated.

   o  The procedures and policies of the immediate source of the
      metadata; in particular, any procedures the immediate source has
      with regard to aggregation of metadata from other sources.

   o  The policies and procedures implemented by agents along the
      publication path from the original metadata registrar: this may be
      determined either by examination of the published procedures of
      each agent in turn, or may be simplified if the entity metadata
      includes publication path metadata as described in the
      [SAML2MetadataDRI] extension.

   o  The policies and procedures implemented by the original metadata
      registrar.

   o  The definition of the category itself; in particular, any
      statements it makes about whether membership of the category may
      be self-asserted, or may only be asserted by particular
      authorities.

   Although entity category support attribute values will often be
   defined as self-asserted claims by the containing entity, the
   provenance of the metadata remains relevant to a relying party's
   decision to accept a claim of support as legitimate, and the specific
   definition of a support claim will influence the assurance required
   to act on it.
