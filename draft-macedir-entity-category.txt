1.  Introduction and Motivation

   This document describes an attribute for use by the EntityAttribute
   extension to SAML metadata (denoted "entity category attribute"
   below).  The entity category attribute is used to denote the type or
   category of the SAML entity with wich the attribute is associated.

   The category of an entity MAY be used to provision policy for release
   of attributes from an Identity Provider but other uses is also
   possible.  This document only specifies syntax and semantics for the
   attribute, it does not specify a controlled vocabulary for the
   attribute values.  It is expected that other specifications will
   provide management and discovery of the values of the entity category
   attribute.

2.  Syntax

   When asserted in SAML metadata the entity category attribute MUST be
   represented using an Attribute element with @NameFormat
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
   http://macedir.org/entity-category.  The Entity Category attribute
   MAY contain multiple AttributeValue elements.  A single
   EntityAttributes element MUST NOT contain multiple separate Attribute
   elements for the same attribute type and instead such cases MUST be
   represented as mutiple AttributeValue type.

   The AttributeValue element MUST contain a URI.  The URI provides a
   unique identifier of the entity category.  This document does not
   specify how such values are discovered but future versions of this
   specification may reference or establish a registry for such values.

3.  Semantics

   By associating an entity category attribute with a SAML metadata
   entity the publisher of that metdata attests to the fact that
   according to the publisher the SAML metadata entity has the
   properties and semantics associated with each of the attribute
   values.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD - basically we need to talk about the importance of keeping FOP
   control over the attribute here.
