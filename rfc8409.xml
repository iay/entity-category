        This document describes two SAML entity attributes: one that can be
        used to assign category membership semantics to an entity and another
        for use in claiming interoperation with or support for
        entities in such categories.
      </t>

        This document is a product of the working group process of the

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
      <t>
        This document describes a SAML attribute called the
	"entity category attribute".
        Values of this attribute represent entity types
        or categories. When used with the
        <xref target="SAML2MetadataAttr">SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for Entity Attributes</xref>,
        each such entity category attribute value represents a claim that the entity thus labeled
        meets the requirements of, and is asserted to be a member of, the indicated category.
      </t>

      <t>
        These category membership claims MAY be used by a relying party to provision policy
        for release of attributes from an identity provider, to influence user interface decisions
        such as those related to identity provider discovery, or for any other purpose.
        In general, the intended uses of any claim of membership in a given category will
        depend on the details of the category's definition and will often be included as
        part of that definition.
      </t>

      <t>
        Entity category attribute values are URIs. Therefore, this document does not specify a
        controlled vocabulary for assigning such values; they may be defined
        by any appropriate authority without any requirement for central registration.  It is anticipated that
        other specifications may provide management and discovery mechanisms for entity category
        attribute values.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document also describes a SAML attribute called the
	"entity category support attribute". This attribute
        contains URI values that represent claims that an entity supports and/or interoperates with
        entities in a given category or categories. These values, defined in conjunction with
        specific entity category attribute values, provide entities in a category with the means to identify
        peer entities that wish to interact with them in a fashion described by the category specification.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document does not specify any values for either the entity category attribute
        or the entity category support attribute.

          Entity category attribute values MUST be URIs. Such values are
          also referred to as "category URIs" in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is RECOMMENDED that http:-scheme or https:-scheme URIs are used;
          it is further RECOMMENDED that a category URI
          resolves to a human-readable document defining the category.
        </t>

        <t>
          Authorities defining entity categories MUST produce a specification of the entity
          category and SHOULD make arrangement for the category URI to resolve to the
          specification in human-readable form.
        </t>

        <t>
          Authorities defining entity categories MAY use versioning of category URIs where
          appropriate; if versioning is used, each version of the specification of the entity category
          SHOULD clearly indicate the latest version of the category URI (and hence of the
          specification).



          The specification SHOULD include a description of
          how the authority defining the entity category implements governance
          for the specification if the specification is updated.
        </t>

        <t>
          When used in SAML metadata or protocol elements, the entity category attribute MUST
          be encoded as a SAML 2.0 Attribute element with @NameFormat urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri
          and @Name http://macedir.org/entity-category.
        </t>

        <t>
          A SAML entity is associated with one or more categories by including the
          Attribute element described here in the entity's metadata through
	  use of the metadata extension defined in
          <xref target="SAML2MetadataAttr"/>. In this extension, the
          Attribute element is contained within an mdattr:EntityAttributes
          element directly contained within an md:Extensions element directly
          contained within the entity's md:EntityDescriptor.
        </t>

        <t>
          The meaning of the entity category attribute is not defined by this specification if it
          appears anywhere else within a metadata instance or within any other XML document.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the entity category attribute appears more than once in the
          metadata for an entity, relying parties SHOULD interpret the combined
          set of associated attribute values as if they all appeared together
          within a single entity category attribute.

          The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's entity attributes
          represents a series of claims (one for each attribute value) that the entity is
          a member of each named category.  The precise semantics of such a claim depend
          on the definition of the category itself.
        </t>

        <t>
          An entity may be claimed to be a member of more than one category. In this case, the entity
          is claimed to meet the requirements of each category independently unless otherwise
          specified by the category definitions themselves.
        </t>



        <t>
          This document intentionally does not define "category", in order to
          leave the concept as general as possible.
          However, to be useful,
          category definitions SHOULD include the following as appropriate:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              A definition of the authorities who may validly assert
              membership in the category.  While membership in some categories may be
              self-asserted informally by an entity's owner, others may need to be
              validated by third parties such as the entity's home federation or other
              registrar.
            </t>
            <t>
              A set of criteria by which an entity's membership in the category can be
              objectively assessed.
            </t>
            <t>
              A definition of the processes by which valid authorities
              may determine that an entity meets the category's membership criteria.
            </t>
            <t>
              A description of the anticipated uses for category membership by relying parties.
            </t>
            <t>
              A statement indicating the applicability or otherwise of membership
              of the entity category to different SAML role descriptors and any
              protocol support restrictions that may be relevant.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          Entity categories SHOULD NOT be used to indicate the certification
          status of an entity regarding its conformance to the requirements
          of an identity assurance framework.



          The SAML extension defined in
	  <xref target="SAML2IDAssuranceProfile"/> SHOULD be used
          for this purpose.
        </t>

        <t>
          If significant changes are made to a category definition, the new version of
          the category SHOULD be represented by a different category URI
          so that the old and new versions can be distinguished by a relying party. It
          is for this reason that authorities defining entity categories MAY
          employ some form of versioning for category URIs. When versioning is
          used, each version of the entity category MUST be treated as a separate URI.
        </t>



        <t>
          No ordering relation is defined for entity category attribute values.
          Entity category attribute values MUST be treated as opaque strings
          for the purpose of comparison. In particular, if the specification defining the
          entity category relies on versioning of the category URI, a relying
          party MUST NOT assume any particular ordering between different versions of
          the category URI. Any order between versions MUST be spelled out in the
          specification.

Note that the values are URIs rather than URLs, so that it is not necessary for

        The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's entity attributes

        relevant to a relying party's decision to accept a claim of support as legitimate,
        and the specific definition of a support claim will influence the assurance
        required to act on it.
      </t>

      <t>
        The conclusion that a claim of category membership or support is justified and
        should be acted upon may require a determination of the origin of the claim.
        This may not be necessary if the immediate source of the metadata is trusted to such
        an extent that the trust calculation is essentially delegated to it.
      </t>

      <t>
        In many cases, a claim will be included in an entity's metadata by the
        original metadata registrar on behalf of the entity's owner, and the mdrpi:RegistrationInfo
        element's @registrationAuthority is available to carry the registrar's identity.
        However, any agent that is part of the chain of custody between the original registrar and the final
        relying party may have added, removed, or transformed claims according to local policy.
        For example, an agent charged with redistributing metadata may remove claims it regards
        as untrustworthy or add others that were not already present if they have value to
        its intended audience.
