1.  Introduction

   This document describes a SAML attribute referred to here as the
   "entity category attribute".  Values of this attribute represent
   entity types or categories.  When used with the SAML V2.0 Metadata
   Extension for Entity Attributes [SAML2MetadataAttr], each such entity
   category attribute value represents a claim that the entity thus
   labeled meets the requirements of, and is asserted to be a member of,
   the indicated category.

   These category membership claims MAY be used by a relying party to
   provision policy for release of attributes from an identity provider,
   to influence user interface decisions such as those related to
   identity provider discovery, or for any other purpose.  In general,
   the intended uses of any claim of membership in a given category will
   depend on the details of the category's definition and will often be
   included as part of that definition.

   Entity category attribute values are URIs; therefore, this document
   does not specify a controlled vocabulary for assigning entity
   category values.  Category URIs may be defined by any appropriate
   authority without any requirement for central registration.  It is
   anticipated that other specifications may provide management and
   discovery mechanisms for entity category attribute values.

   This document also describes a SAML attribute referred to here as the
   "entity category support attribute".  This attribute contains URI
   values that represent claims that an entity supports and/or
   interoperates with entities in a given category or categories.  These
   values, defined in conjunction with specific entity category values,
   provide entities in a category with the means to identify peer
   entities that wish to interact with them in a fashion described by
   the category specification.

   This document does not specify any values for either the entity
   category attribute or the entity category support attribute.

1.1.  REFEDS Document Process

   The Research and Education FEDerations [REFEDS] group is the voice
   that articulates the mutual needs of research and education identity
   federations worldwide.  It aims to represent the requirements of
   research and education in the ever-growing space of access and
   identity management.

   From time to time, REFEDS will publish a document in the RFC Series.
   Such documents will be published as part of the Independent
   Submission stream [RFC4844]; however, the REFEDS Working Group sign-
   off process will have been followed for these documents, as described
   in the REFEDS Participant's Agreement [REFEDS.agreement].

   This document is a product of the REFEDS Working Group process.

2.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Entity Category Attribute

3.1.  Syntax

   Entity category attribute values MUST be valid URIs.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that http:-scheme or https:-scheme URIs are used; it is
   further RECOMMENDED that an entity category URI resolves to a human-
   readable document defining the category.

   Authorities defining entity categories MUST produce a specification
   of the entity category and SHOULD make arrangement for the entity
   category URI to resolve to the specification in human-readable form.



Young, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 8409                     Entity Category                   July 2018


   Authorities defining entity categories MAY use versioning of entity
   category URIs where appropriate; if versioning is used, each version
   of the specification of the entity category SHOULD clearly indicate
   the latest version of the entity category URI (and hence of the
   specification).  The specification SHOULD include a description of
   how the authority defining the entity category implements governance
   for the specification if the specification is updated.

   When used in SAML metadata or protocol elements, the entity category
   attribute MUST be encoded as a SAML 2.0 Attribute element with
   @NameFormat urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
   http://macedir.org/entity-category.

   A SAML entity is associated with one or more categories by including
   the Attribute element described here in the entity's metadata through
   use of the metadata extension defined in [SAML2MetadataAttr].  In
   this extension, the Attribute element is contained within an
   mdattr:EntityAttributes element directly contained within an
   md:Extensions element directly contained within the entity's
   md:EntityDescriptor.

   The meaning of the entity category attribute is not defined by this
   specification if it appears anywhere else within a metadata instance
   or within any other XML document.

   If the entity category attribute Attribute element appears more than
   once in the metadata for an entity, the combined set of associated
   attribute values SHOULD be interpreted by relying parties as if they
   all appeared within a single Attribute element.

3.2.  Semantics

   The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's
   entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for each
   attribute value) that the entity is a member of each named category.
   The precise semantics of such a claim depend on the definition of the
   category itself.

   An entity may be claimed to be a member of more than one category.
   In this case, the entity is claimed to meet the requirements of each
   category independently unless otherwise specified by the category
   definitions themselves.

   This document intentionally does not define "category", in order to
   leave the concept as general as possible.  However, to be useful,
   category definitions SHOULD include the following as appropriate:





Young, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 4]

RFC 8409                     Entity Category                   July 2018


   o  A definition of the authorities who may validly assert membership
      in the category.  While membership in some categories may be self-
      asserted informally by an entity's owner, others may need to be
      validated by third parties such as the entity's home federation or
      other registrar.

   o  A set of criteria by which an entity's membership in the category
      can be objectively assessed.

   o  A definition of the processes by which valid authorities may
      determine that an entity meets the category's membership criteria.

   o  A description of the anticipated uses for category membership by
      relying parties.

   o  A statement indicating the applicability or otherwise of
      membership of the entity category to different SAML role
      descriptors and any protocol support restrictions that may be
      relevant.

   Entity categories SHOULD NOT be used to indicate the certification
   status of an entity regarding its conformance to the requirements of
   an identity assurance framework.  The SAML extension defined in
   [SAML2IDAssuranceProfile] SHOULD be used for this purpose.

   If significant changes are made to a category definition, the new
   version of the category SHOULD be represented by a different category
   URI so that the old and new versions can be distinguished by a
   relying party.  It is for this reason that authorities defining
   entity categories MAY employ some form of versioning for entity
   category URIs.  When versioning is used, each version of the entity
   category MUST be treated as a separate URI.

   No ordering relation is defined for entity category value URIs.
   Entity category attribute value URIs MUST be treated as opaque
   strings for the purpose of comparison.  In particular, if the
   specification defining the entity category relies on versioning of
   the entity category URI, a relying party MUST NOT assume any
   particular ordering between different versions of the entity
   category.  Any order between versions MUST be spelled out in the
   specification.

4.  Entity Category Support Attribute

4.1.  Syntax

   Entity category support attribute values MUST be URIs.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that http:-scheme or https:-scheme URLs are used; it is
   further RECOMMENDED that each such value resolves to a human-readable
   document defining the value's semantics.  A given entity category
   value MAY be associated with multiple support values in order to
   allow for multiple forms of support, participation, or interoperation
   with entities in the category.  The authority defining the entity
   category and entity category support values MUST clearly describe the
   relationship between (all versions of) the entity category URI and
   (all versions of) the entity category support URIs as applicable in
   the entity category specification.

   The entity category support attribute MUST be encoded as a SAML 2.0
   Attribute element with @NameFormat
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri and @Name
   http://macedir.org/entity-category-support.

   Claims that a SAML entity implements support for one or more
   categories are represented by including the Attribute element
   described here in the entity's metadata through use of the metadata
   extension defined in [SAML2MetadataAttr].  In this extension, the
   Attribute element is contained within an mdattr:EntityAttributes
   element directly contained within an md:Extensions element directly
   contained within the entity's md:EntityDescriptor.






Young, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 6]

RFC 8409                     Entity Category                   July 2018


   The meaning of the entity category support attribute is not defined
   by this specification if it appears anywhere else within a metadata
   instance or within any other XML document.

   If the entity category support attribute Attribute element appears
   more than once in the metadata for an entity, the combined set of
   associated attribute values SHOULD be interpreted by relying parties
   as if they all appeared within a single Attribute element.

4.2.  Semantics

   The presence of the entity category support attribute within an
   entity's entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for
   each attribute value) that the entity supports peer entities in a
   category in a particular fashion.  The precise semantics of such a
   claim depend on the definition of the category support identifier
   itself.  Category support claims will often be defined to be self-
   asserted.

   An entity may be claimed to support more than one category.  In this
   case, the entity is claimed to meet the support requirements of each
   category independently unless otherwise specified by the category
   definitions themselves.

   This document intentionally does not define "support" for a category,
   in order to leave the concept as general as possible.  It is assumed
   that entity category definitions MAY define one or more support
   values signifying particular definitions for "support" by peers as
   motivated by use cases arising from the definition of the category
   itself.

   A common case is expected to be the definition of a single support
   value whose URI is identical to that defined for the category itself.

   If significant changes are made to a category support definition, the
   new version SHOULD be represented by a different category support URI
   so that the old and new versions can be distinguished by a relying
   party.  It is for this reason that authorities defining entity
   categories support MAY employ some form of versioning.  When
   versioning is used, each version of the entity category support URI
   MUST be treated as a separate URI.

   No ordering relation is defined over entity category URIs.  Entity
   category attribute support value URIs MUST be treated as opaque
   strings for the purpose of comparison.  In particular, if the
   specification defining the entity category support values relies on
   versioning, a relying party MUST NOT assume any particular ordering

   between different versions of the entity category support URI.  Any
   order between versions MUST be spelled out in the specification.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   The presence of the entity category attribute within an entity's
   entity attributes represents a series of claims (one for each
   attribute value) that the entity is a member of the named categories.
   Before accepting and acting on such claims, any relying party needs
   to establish, at a level of assurance sufficient for the intended
   use, a chain of trust concluding that the claim is justified.

   Some of the elements in such a chain of trust might include:

   o  The integrity of the metadata delivered to the relying party, for
      example, as assured by a digital signature.

   o  If the entity category attribute is carried within a signed
      assertion, the assertion itself must be evaluated.

   o  The policies and procedures of the immediate source of the
      metadata, in particular, any procedures the immediate source has
      with regard to aggregation of metadata from other sources.



Young, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 8]

RFC 8409                     Entity Category                   July 2018


   o  The policies and procedures implemented by agents along the
      publication path from the original metadata registrar.  This may
      be determined by examination of the published procedures of each
      agent in turn or may be simplified if the entity metadata includes
      publication path metadata in mdrpi:PublicationPath elements as
      described in Section 2.3.1 of [SAML2MetadataRPI].

   o  The policies and procedures implemented by the original metadata
      registrar.  The registrar's identity may be known implicitly or
      may be determined from the entity metadata if it includes an
      mdrpi:RegistrationInfo element and corresponding
      @registrationAuthority attribute as described in Section 2.1.1 of
      [SAML2MetadataRPI].

   o  The definition of the category itself, in particular, any
      statements it makes about whether membership of the category may
      be self-asserted or may only be asserted by particular
      authorities.

   Although entity category support attribute values will often be
   defined as self-asserted claims by the containing entity, the
   provenance of the metadata remains relevant to a relying party's
   decision to accept a claim of support as legitimate, and the specific
   definition of a support claim will influence the assurance required
   to act on it.

   The conclusion that a claim of category membership or support is
   justified and should be acted upon may require a determination of the
   origin of the claim.  This may not be necessary if the immediate
   source of the metadata is trusted to such an extent that the trust
   calculation is essentially delegated to it.

   In many cases, a claim will be included in an entity's metadata by
   the original metadata registrar on behalf of the entity's owner, and
   the mdrpi:RegistrationInfo element's @registrationAuthority attribute
   is available to carry the registrar's identity.  However, any agent
   that is part of the chain of custody between the original registrar
   and the final relying party may have added, removed, or transformed
   claims according to local policy.  For example, an agent charged with
   redistributing metadata may remove claims it regards as untrustworthy
   or add others that were not already present if they have value to its
   intended audience.
